Phasmophobia Smudge Timer
===

This is a smudge timer for the game phasmophobia. It will let you time your smudges for ghosts like the Demon, Spirit, and Moroi.
I have also added an Obambo timer so that when you open the house door you start a secondary timer for the Obombo to determine if it is this ghost.
In total this program will help with 4 ghosts.
